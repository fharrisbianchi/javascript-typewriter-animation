The "Typewriter Animation" is a web project where text is displayed letter by letter in a way that simulates a typewriter effect. This creates a dynamic animation, where each character appears with a delay, as if it's being typed in real time.

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the animation gives the text a lively appearance, with customizable typing speed and an optional blinking caret to enhance the effect. The project can be used in websites, presentations, or any interface where a dynamic text display is desired.

Key Features:

    Simulates a typewriter effect where each character of a string is "typed" onto the screen one by one.
    Uses CSS animations for a blinking caret at the end of the text to simulate the appearance of a live typing session.
    The speed of the typing effect can be adjusted using JavaScript, allowing for control over the pacing of the animation.

Ideal for:

    Websites that need dynamic text animations.
    Creative presentations or landing pages where interactive text draws attention.
    Demonstrations of basic JavaScript animations and DOM manipulation.
